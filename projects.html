                        My last project in the first year was to make a fantasy socializer game that was based on the real life park "Dakpark" in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. My team and I decided to make a fantasy dating simulator based in an alternative reality of this park.
                        We felt it would grasp the fantasy and socializer part quite well. This game is almost entirely made in javascript.
                        <br>
                        We decided to use the framework Excalibur JS since we liked the way Excalibur made it easy to swap Scenes and Actors.

                        My third project was centered around making a web service for people with physical disabilities around sports. After interviewing people from our target audience, our team made a website with four web-services around this topic. In my web service an user
                        can choose a sport they play and choose which accommodations to the building they would need to get around. 
                        <br>
                        The web service would then show building that host the sport they want to play that would be accessable to them.

                        For my second project I made a reservation system for a coaching practicion that is yet to set up business using PHP and MySQL. By making an account, you can see your reservation that you have made that are linked to your account which are fully edittable and can be cancellen if needed.
                        <br>
                        The owner of the practicion has an overview of all reservations made. The reservation database is protected against SQL injections and passwords for the accounts are first hashed, then stored.

                        My first project I finished for my studies was this mobile device locker. We made a product that locks phones and other devices inside and locks them in place for the amount of time wanted by the user.
                        <br>
                        This product used an adafruit circuit playground and a small engine to turn a 3d printed gear that moves a small rectangular 3d printed piece that locks in place when the timer is set. This piece moves back 
                        when the timer is paused or if the timer has ended.

                <h3>Who am I?</h3>
                    <p class="ptext">
                        My name is Angelique Smit. I am a 20-year-old student studying at Hogeschool Rotterdam (Ruas) with a strong passion for creativity and technology. Early in 2022, I started to get into programming and enrolled into the study CMGT. 
                        Besides programming, I got taught to converse with clients to determine what they expect from a product; how to design the product and plan out how long this will take. These skills will be useful in the workforce.

                    <h3> My Hobbies</h3>
                    <p class="ptext">
                        During my studies, I discovered new hobbies which have taught me new skills. One of these hobbies is sewing. In my free time, I've started making my own clothes after I learned how to sew for one of my projects.
                    </p>

                    <p class="ptext">
                    Besides just sewing, I also draw and game in my free time. Though most of my recent drawings have been for school projects, I still occasionally draw for my own pleasure. Though gamming isn't often mentioned as a hobby
                    due to the stigma surrounding gaming, playing with others in a fast-paced environment improved my communication skills. I managed to me more concise and fast while communicating, which is a valuable and sought after skill in the workforce.
